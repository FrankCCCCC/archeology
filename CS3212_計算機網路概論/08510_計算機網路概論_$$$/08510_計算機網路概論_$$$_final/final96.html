</FONT><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><LI>What are the characteristics of a transport layer data flow? You may use a credit scheme to control the data flow. A conservative approach is to allow new TPDUs be transmitted up to the limit of available buffer space in the receiving end. This may limit the throughput of the transport connection. How could you increase the throughput by taking a more aggressive approach? Estimate the effectiveness of your approach. (15%)</LI></P>

   data link layer.(8%)

2. Why has the PCM sampling time been set at 125 micro seconds?(7%)

3. State two reasons why the Manchester encoding scheme is used in the Ethernet.(8%)

4. Why the CRC error check is used in most communication systems?(5%) With the 
   generator polynomial x+1, what is the CRC code for the message x+x+1?(10%) Give 
   one example of damaged frame that is not detected by the CRC check.(5%)

5. State the main difference of the go-back-n ARQ and the selective-repeat ARQ.(7%) 
   Give one situation that is more suitable to use each of the above two ARQs.(8%)

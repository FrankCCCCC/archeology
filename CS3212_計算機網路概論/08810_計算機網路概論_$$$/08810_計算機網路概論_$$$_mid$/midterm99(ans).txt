1. State the major functions of the physical layer.(7%) the major functions of the 
   data link layer.(8%)
ans:(1) The PL is concerned with transmitting raw bits over a communication channel. 
        The design issues have to do with making sure that one side sends a 1 bit, 
        it is received by the other side as a 1 bit, not as a 0 bit.
    (2) The DLL is to take a raw transmission facility and transform it into a line 
        and appears the error-free results to NL. It accomplishes the task by having
        the sender break the input data up into data frames,transmit the frames 
        sequentially and process the Ack frames sent back by the receiver.

2. Why has the PCM sampling time been set at 125 micro seconds?(7%)
ans: By Nyquist's Theorem:
     maximum data rate = 2Hlog V (bits/s)
                       = 2*(4KHz)*log 2
                       = 8000 (samples/s)
     Thus, the PCM sampling time = 1/8000 (s) = 125 (μs)

3. State two reasons why the Manchester encoding scheme is used in the Ethernet.(8%)
ans:a. Synchronization
    b. Error detection
    c. No dc component

4. Why the CRC error check is used in most communication systems?(5%) With the generator 
   polynomial x+1, what is the CRC code for the message x+x+1?(10%) Give one example of
   damaged frame that is not detected by the CRC check.(5%)
ans:(1) a. Easy hardware implement 
        b. Detection of burst errors
   (2) CRC code = 10100001111
   (3)transmitted frame = T
      received frame = Tr
      error pattern = E
      If E is divisible by the generator, then Tr is a damaged frame and isn't detected 
      by CRC check.

5. State the main difference of the go-back-n ARQ and the selective-repeat ARQ.(7%) 
   Give one situation that is more suitable to use each of the above two ARQs.(8%)
ans (a) Go-back-n ARQ: Receiver discards all subsequent frames of a damaged frame,
     sending no ack's for the discard frames and retransmit all discarded frames.
     Selective-Repeat ARQ: Receiver stores all the correct frames following the
     bad one.Sender retransmits only the bad frame, not all its successors.
    (b) go-back-n ARQ適用於傳送端的buffer夠大，傳送環境的bandwidth也夠大的環境之下,而
        selective-repeat ARQ則較適用於傳送端的buffer不太多，bandwidth亦不太大的環境。

6. What is the optimal window size of a sliding window protocol.(5%) A 3000-km long T1 
   trunk is used to transmit 64-byte frames using go-back-n protocol. If the propagation
   speed is 6 micro second/km, how many bits should the sequence numbers be in a frame?
ans  (a) 2^n-1
     (b) Tframe  = 64*8*106 / 1.544*220 = 316.244 μsec
         Tpop   =3000*2*6 = 36000 μsec
         Tframe / Tpop = 113.8
         所以需要7個 bits來解決sequence number的問題

7. Explain why 1-persistent CSMA is used in Ethernet.(8%) Why there is the LCFS(Last 
   Come First Serve) phenomenon in the CSMA/CD protocol?(7%)
ans:Ⅰ.因為1-persistence CSMA可以監聽網路的使用狀況，若無人使用則立即傳送資料，如此可
       以避免不必要的資源浪費，而且不會像non-persistence或p-persistence般傳送前需先等
       待一段random time。且在low load情況下有較高的throughput。
    Ⅱ.因為CSMA/CD具備網路監聽與衝撞偵測的功能，因此一旦發衝撞發生後即放棄繼續傳送，
       並採取binary exponential back-off演算法以減少下一次衝撞發生的機率。也因為此演
       算法而使得LCFS的情形發生，因為一旦衝撞發生，所有偵測到該衝撞的station即開始進
       行binary exponential back-off演算法，而此刻衝撞已經消失並剛好有一個station要
       傳送資料，於是此station在無衝撞的情形下便可進行其傳送工作，而這正是LCFS。

8. Consider the delay of pure ALOHA versus slotted ALOHA at low load. Which one is 
   less? Explain your answer.(10%)
ans:在low load的情況之下，pure ALOHA有較小的delay。因為pure ALOHA可以在任何時間提出
    request，由於是在low load的情況下，所以發生collision的機率不高，相對的取得資源的
    機會較多因而使得delay不大。而slotted ALOHA則必須等待某個特定的time-period才能送
    出request，因此其delay會較pure ALOHA來的長。

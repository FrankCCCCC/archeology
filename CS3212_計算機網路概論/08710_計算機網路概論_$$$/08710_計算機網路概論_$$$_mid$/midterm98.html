</FONT><B><P>1. State two reasons why the Manchester encoding scheme is used in the Ethernet.(5%) Enumerate at least five considerations in choosing an encoding scheme in the physical layer of a network. Briefly explain why.(10%)</P>
<P>2. State the main difference of the go-back-n ARQ and the selective-repeat ARQ.(5%) Give one situation that is more suitable to use either of the above two ARQs.(10%)</P>
<P>3. A 3000-km long T1 trunk is used to transmit 64-byte frames using go-back-n protocol. If the propagation speed is 6 micro-second/km, how many bits should the frame sequence numbers be?(10%)</P>
<P>4. Explain why 1-persistent CSMA is used in Ethernet.(8%) Why there is the LCFS(Last Come First Serve) phenomenon in the CSMA/CD protocol?(7%)</P>
<P>5. What happens in a token bus if a station accepts the token and then crashes immediately? How does the protocol handle this case?(10%)</P>
